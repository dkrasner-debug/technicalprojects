## Scoping Section 508 Compliance with the US Department of Housing and Urban Development
### Research Question: _In order to begin preparing for [Section 508 Digital Accessibility requirements coming from the White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/ofcio/m-24-08-strengthening-digital-accessibility-and-the-management-of-section-508-of-the-rehabilitation-act/), I was asked by HUD to perform a preliminary analysis of some of their main policy handbooks, mapping the website structure along the way. Within this, I was able to conduct a first audit, identifying policies and webpages that that require updating to meet compliance in the future.
This project includes a [basic methodology](https://github.com/dkrasner-debug/technicalprojects/blob/main/Methodological%20Overview.docx) and a [proposed set of next steps](https://github.com/dkrasner-debug/technicalprojects/blob/main/Project%20Proposal.docx), both of which can be accessed via download by clicking "Raw."_

Note: This was part of an internship done at HUD for my graduate program.
